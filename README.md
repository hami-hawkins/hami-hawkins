## About Me ❤️

My name is Hāmi Hawkins and I am a graduate of Dev Academy Aotearoa 2024. 

After spending ten years as a live theatre technician specialising in lighting and sound design, I decided to swap being a techie to working with technology through software and web development. You can check out some of projects I've been privileged enough to work on down below.

I am currently based in 📍Pōneke, New Zealand and am always looking for new ways to challenge myself in the development realm.

## My Projects 🖤

### - Tag Hunter (v1) 🎨

[Tag Hunter](https://taghunter-mako-kotare-2024.pushed.nz/) was developed as a final group project at Dev Academy Aotearoa in September 2024. It is a GeoGuessr-style game where users are provided an image of some Wellington street art and must locate where in the city it can be found. 

I was involved with implementing Auth0 into the application; this provided us with the ability to carefully curate the user experience by only offering certain features to users who would log in. I also spent some time developing tests for our code, and am still chipping away at it in my own time.

If you want to have a more in-depth look at the code, you can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/hami-hawkins/tag-hunter)

### - Kes-Ke-Say 🗣️

Kes-Ke-Say was developed as a facilitator-led project at Dev Academy Aotearoa. It is a social media application where users can write posts, join groups and network.

This was a full-stack application that was split across three teams: User, Posts, and Groups. I was a member of Team Groups and wrote code that meant users could see all groups available, as well as members of any certain group.

A key objective for this project was ensuring full testing coverage for all elements. As such, all code was tested in full before being added to the main branch.

Although this application is not currently deployed, feel free to check out all the code in our repo [here](https://github.com/hami-hawkins/kes-ke-say)
